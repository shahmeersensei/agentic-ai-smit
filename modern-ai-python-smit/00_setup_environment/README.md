# 00 - Setup Environment

This module helps you prepare your development environment for the course. It contains quick setup notes for Colab and VS Code and simple scripts/notebooks to verify your Python installation and common libraries.

Follow the steps in `setup_vscode.md` or open `setup_colab.ipynb` to configure a cloud notebook environment. Run `test_environment.py` locally to confirm your setup.
