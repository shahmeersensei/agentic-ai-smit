# Setup VS Code

Short checklist to get VS Code ready for the course:

1. Install Python 3.10+ and add it to PATH.
2. Install the Microsoft Python extension and Pylance.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (venv) for the project.
4. Open the `modern-ai-python-smit` folder in VS Code and select the project interpreter.

Tip: Use the `test_environment.py` script to verify your interpreter and common packages after setup.
